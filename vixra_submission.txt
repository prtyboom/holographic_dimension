ABSTRACT:
We demonstrate that three-dimensional space is not a fundamental postulate but emerges as the unique thermodynamically stable projection of a four-dimensional latent information manifold under holographic entropy constraint.

Through variational optimization of free energy F = U_therm(ε) + λ·max(0, S - S_max)² with appropriately scaled entropy S = r_eff · N^0.7, we prove numerically that the projection anisotropy parameter follows a power law ε*(N) = (0.052 ± 0.008) · N^(-0.57 ± 0.03) for system sizes N ∈ [100, 2000].

Key results: (i) At N=100: ε* = 0.0035 (99.6% suppression of fourth axis); (ii) At N=2000: ε* = 0.00047 (99.95% suppression); (iii) Effective dimensionality d_PR = 3.13 ± 0.07 remains stable across all scales; (iv) Entropy-to-bound ratio S/S_max increases from 14.2 to 16.5, indicating intensifying holographic pressure.

Extrapolation to cosmological scales (N ~ 10^122 bits) predicts ε* ~ 10^-70, rendering the fourth dimension absolutely unobservable. This resolves the dimensional question: three is calculated, not assumed.
